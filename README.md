## I'm a novice Back-end developer with 1 year experience in web development, Django and REST API development. Currently.  I have been writing in the Python programming language for more than 2 years. At the moment, I'm deeply interested in the Junior Python back-end developer industry. I'm writing websites backend for my friends and conduct online lessons in the Python programming language in order to gain a lot of experience and increase projects in my portfolio.
